 <h1 style="text-align:center;">BIRIYANI</h1>
<h1>INGREDIENTS:</h1>
<p> Here's a common biryani recipe that can be adapted for both mutton and chicken. You can follow the same steps for either meat; just adjust the cooking time as needed since mutton usually takes longer to cook than chicken.

Ingredients:

For Marinating the Meat (Mutton or Chicken):

500g meat (mutton or chicken), cut into pieces
1 cup yogurt
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon garam masala powder
Salt to taste
For the Rice:

2 cups basmati rice
4 cups water
1 bay leaf
2-3 green cardamom pods
2-3 cloves
Salt to taste
For the Biryani:

2 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust to your spice preference)
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon garam masala powder
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves and mint leaves for garnish
Whole Spices:

1 bay leaf
2-3 green cardamom pods
2-3 cloves
1-inch cinnamon stick
For Layering:

Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk (optional)
Fried onions (for garnish)
Ghee (clarified butter) for drizzling
Instructions:

Marinate the Meat:

In a bowl, combine the meat pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (for mutton, you can marinate longer, even overnight, for better flavor).
Cook the Rice:

Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
Add the soaked rice, bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, and salt.
Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (parboiled). Drain and set it aside.
Prepare the Biryani:

In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium heat.
Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears.
Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Cook the masala until the oil separates from it.
Add the marinated meat and cook until it's partially cooked (for mutton, this may take longer; ensure it's tender but not fully cooked at this stage).
Stir in yogurt and mix well. Cook for a few more minutes.
Layer the Biryani:

In a heavy-bottomed pot or biryani pot, spread a layer of partially cooked rice.
Place the meat mixture evenly over the rice.
Sprinkle some chopped fresh coriander and mint leaves.
Add another layer of rice on top.
Drizzle the saffron milk (optional) and ghee over the rice.
Garnish with fried onions, coriander leaves, and mint leaves.
Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):

Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to trap steam.
Place the pot on a very low flame (you can also place a tava or griddle under the pot to distribute heat evenly) and cook for about 30-40 minutes (for mutton) or 20-25 minutes (for chicken).
Alternatively, you can bake the biryani in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for the same duration.
Serve:

Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers.
Serve hot with raita or salad on the side.
Enjoy your homemade mutton or chicken biryani! Adjust the spice levels to your preference.</p>
